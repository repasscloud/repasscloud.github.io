## LunaVPN

Welcome to LunaVPN, a VPN service that was built to provide online privacy and
security using modern VPN technology.

### LunaVPN's offerings

**Cutting-edge technology**: LunaVPN used the WireGuard protocol to deliver a
fast, secure VPN experience. WireGuard was selected for its modern cryptography
and efficient design, supporting strong security without unnecessary overhead.

**Dedicated isolated instances**: LunaVPN was designed around dedicated,
isolated instances so customers did not share VPN resources with other users.
This approach aimed to reduce noisy-neighbour risk and improve isolation.

**Global accessibility**: LunaVPN offered secure internet access from multiple
regions. Server availability and locations varied over time based on capacity
and operational requirements.

**Simplicity and transparency**: LunaVPN aimed to provide a straightforward
setup experience and clear product expectations, avoiding hidden fees and
unclear configurations.

### Privacy and logging

LunaVPN was designed to prioritise privacy. Operational logging was limited to
what was necessary to run the service reliably and securely.

### WireGuard protocol

LunaVPN's use of WireGuard was intentional. WireGuard provides a modern,
auditable protocol with strong encryption primitives and a minimal attack
surface.

### Why LunaVPN existed

**Privacy-first design**: LunaVPN was built to reduce exposure to invasive
tracking and to protect traffic over untrusted networks.

**Remote access safety**: The service was intended to support travellers and
remote users needing secure connectivity on public networks.

**Multi-device coverage**: A single instance could be used across multiple
devices, depending on configuration and plan limits at the time.
