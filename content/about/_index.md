## RePass Cloud at a Glance

RePass Cloud Pty Ltd is an Australian software company focused on building
secure, enterprise-grade SaaS products and cloud automation solutions.

Our flagship platform is **Cinturon360**, designed to help organisations reduce
manual effort, improve governance, and scale operational workflows with clear
auditability and strong security controls.

## What We Do

We build and operate products and services that help organisations:

- Automate repetitive operational workflows
- Improve identity and access control with modern authentication
- Increase visibility through dashboards, reporting, and telemetry
- Reduce risk through secure-by-default design, audit logs, and controls

## Our Approach

We take a pragmatic, engineering-led approach:

- **Security-first**: identity-centric access, least privilege, and auditability
- **Enterprise-ready**: clear operational controls, logging, and supportability
- **Integration-minded**: we connect with existing identity, payments, and
  operational systems
- **Data residency aware**: we host where customers need us to host

## Cinturon360

Cinturon360 is our actively developed and maintained enterprise SaaS platform.
It is built to support business and organisational customers and is designed to
work with modern identity platforms and cloud infrastructure.

Key focus areas include:

- Identity and access management (including Microsoft Entra ID)
- Tenant-aware configuration and governance controls
- Operational automation and reporting
- Secure API-driven integration patterns

## Hosting and Regions

We support flexible hosting options to meet customer needs and data residency
requirements.

- Initial customers in Australia and New Zealand are hosted in **Microsoft Azure
  Australia** regions.
- As we expand, we can support additional regions and providers, including
  **AWS** in the United States and **Hetzner** in the European Union, where
  required by customers.

## Technology Focus

Our primary technology focus is the Microsoft ecosystem, including modern .NET
platform development, identity integration, and cloud-native delivery patterns.
We design systems to be maintainable, observable, and resilient in production.

## Working With Us

We work with organisations that value:

- Clear, auditable operational workflows
- Secure authentication and access control
- Practical automation that reduces human error
- Reliable, supportable software delivered with engineering discipline
