## 1. Who We Are

This Privacy Policy applies to RePass Cloud Pty Ltd ("RePass Cloud", "we", "us",
or "our"). It explains how we collect, use, disclose, store, and protect
personal information when you interact with our websites, products, and services
(the "Services").

Our actively developed and maintained enterprise SaaS product is Cinturon360.
We may also operate additional websites, brands, prototypes, or legacy products.
This policy applies to all Services we operate that link to this Privacy Policy.

Examples of sites and brands that may link to this Privacy Policy include:

- <https://repasscloud.com>
- <https://optechx.com>
- Other RePass Cloud websites and service endpoints that link to this policy

Legacy notice:

- LunaVPN is not an active RePass Cloud service. The source code has been made
  available as open source and it is not actively maintained or operated by us.

If you do not agree with this policy, do not use the Services.

## 2. Roles: Controller and Processor

Depending on the context, RePass Cloud may act as:

- **Data controller** (for example, for account administration, billing, and
  operating our websites and marketing activities).
- **Data processor / service provider** (for example, when we process data on
  behalf of a business customer in enterprise SaaS products such as Cinturon360).

Business customers are typically the controller for customer content they upload
to enterprise SaaS products. RePass Cloud processes that content to provide the
Services under customer instructions, applicable agreements, and applicable law.

We collect information from:

- You (when you create an account, use the Services, or contact support).
- Your organisation (when they provision your access).
- Your device and browser (when you access our websites and applications).
- Service providers that help us operate the Services.

We collect the following categories of personal information, depending on how
you use the Services.

### 4.1 Identity and Account Data

- Name
- Email address
- Organisation name and identifiers
- User identifiers and role assignments
- Authentication identifiers issued by identity providers

### 4.2 Authentication and Access Data

We support enterprise authentication via Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) and may
support federated identity providers or OAuth sign-in options where customers
require them. Password-based authentication may be enabled on a per-user basis.

We may process:

- Sign-in events and timestamps
- Authentication logs
- Access tokens and session identifiers (stored as needed for security)
- Multi-factor authentication status (where supplied by identity provider)

Internal access for RePass Cloud personnel is restricted and uses Microsoft
Entra ID authentication.

### 4.3 Customer Content and Business Data (Enterprise SaaS)

For enterprise SaaS (including Cinturon360), business customers may submit and
store content that can include personal information, such as:

- Traveller, employee, or user profile details
- Business contact details
- Booking or operational data (where customers choose to use those features)
- Communications and support context entered within the platform

This content is determined by the customer and their configuration and usage.

### 4.4 Operational, Audit, and Security Logs

We collect operational and security telemetry to protect the Services and meet
audit requirements, including:

- IP addresses
- Authentication logs
- Application and API access logs
- Audit logs (administrative actions and configuration changes)
- Error logs and diagnostic traces
- Performance and availability telemetry

Retention:

- We retain logs for a **minimum of 90 days**.
- We delete logs after **100 days**, unless longer retention is required for
  contractual, legal, or security reasons (for example, an active investigation
  or legal hold).

We do not use logs for advertising purposes.

### 4.5 Device and Technical Data

- Browser type and version
- Device type and operating system
- Approximate location derived from IP (for security and fraud prevention)
- Session metadata and performance metrics

### 4.6 Billing and Payment Data

such as Stripe. We do not store full payment card numbers.

## 5. How We Use Information

We use personal information for the following purposes:

- Deliver support, troubleshoot issues, and respond to enquiries.
- Maintain security, detect abuse, prevent fraud, and investigate incidents.
- Monitor reliability and performance using internal telemetry.
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.
- Business administration, including billing, accounting, and procurement.
- Marketing communications where permitted by law and your preferences.

We do not sell personal information.

We do not use third-party behavioural advertising analytics such as Google

## 6. Legal Bases for Processing

Where applicable law requires a legal basis (for example under GDPR), we rely on
one or more of the following:

- Contract: to provide the Services you or your organisation requested.
- Legitimate interests: to secure and improve Services, prevent fraud, and
  protect our business and users.
- Consent: where required for specific activities (for example certain marketing
  communications, or optional features).
- Legal obligation: to comply with laws and respond to lawful requests.
- Vital interests: to protect safety where applicable.

Where we act as a processor, the customer is responsible for determining the
legal basis for customer content they provide to us.

## 7. Hosting, Data Residency, and Infrastructure

We host customer data using cloud infrastructure providers. Customers may choose
hosting regions or providers depending on product configuration and commercial
terms.

Current and planned hosting approach:

- Initial customers in Australia and New Zealand are hosted in Microsoft Azure
  Australia regions.
- As we expand, we may host in other regions and providers to meet customer
  demand and data residency requirements, including:
  - Australia (Azure)
  - United States (AWS)
  - European Union (Hetzner EU)

If a customer is not explicitly configured for another region, hosting defaults
to Australia.

## 8. Cookies and Similar Technologies

We use cookies and similar technologies primarily for:

- Authentication and session management
- Security controls
- Preferences and settings
- Performance and reliability

We do not use cookies for third-party targeted advertising.

You can control cookies through your browser settings. Some features may not
work properly if you disable cookies.

## 9. Disclosure of Information

We disclose personal information only as necessary to operate the Services, for
the purposes described in this policy, and subject to appropriate protections.

We may disclose information to:

- Cloud infrastructure providers (for hosting and storage).
- Identity providers (for authentication and access management).
- Payment processors (for billing and payments).
- Security and operational vendors (for monitoring and incident response).
- Professional advisers (lawyers, auditors, insurers) under confidentiality.
- Authorities where required by law or to protect rights and safety.
- Business transferees in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale.

We do not sell personal information.

## 10. International Data Transfers

We may process data in Australia, the United States, the European Union, or
other jurisdictions depending on hosting configuration and service operations.

Where required, we implement safeguards such as:

- Contractual protections (including Standard Contractual Clauses where
  applicable)

## 11. Security

We maintain an information security program designed to protect personal
information. Controls may include:

- Multi-factor authentication and strong authentication requirements
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Segmentation and environment controls
- Secure development and change management practices
- Vulnerability management and incident response procedures

No method of transmission or storage is 100 percent secure. We continuously
improve safeguards and respond to threats.

## 12. Data Retention and Deletion

We retain personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes
described in this policy, including legal, tax, accounting, and security needs.

- Security and telemetry logs are generally retained for 90 to 100 days.
- Customer content is retained according to customer instructions and contract
  terms.
- Where deletion is requested, we will take reasonable steps to delete or
  de-identify data unless an exception applies (for example, legal hold,
  security investigation, or legal obligation).

Backups may retain data for limited periods, but data is isolated and protected
and deleted in line with our backup lifecycle.

## 13. Data Breach and Incident Notification

If we become aware of a data breach affecting personal information, we will:

- Investigate and take steps to contain and remediate the incident.
- Notify affected customers and users as required by applicable law and contract.
- Provide information reasonably necessary for customers to meet their own legal
  obligations.
