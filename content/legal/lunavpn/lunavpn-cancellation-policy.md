## 3. Account Closure and Service Termination

All LunaVPN accounts are closed and service access is terminated. Any remaining

Where RePass Cloud controlled LunaVPN operational data, we have taken
reasonable steps to wind down and delete service data associated with closed
accounts as part of the shutdown process, subject to any legal obligations
that require limited retention (for example accounting records).

If you have a specific privacy request relating to LunaVPN, contact:

## 5. Open Source Availability

The LunaVPN source code has been made available as open source for community
use. This does not mean the LunaVPN service remains active or supported by
RePass Cloud.

Any use of the open source code is at your own risk and subject to the license
terms in the relevant repository.

## 6. Changes to This Notice

We may update this notice if required to reflect closure details or respond to
legal and operational requirements.
