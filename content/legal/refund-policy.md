## 1. Scope

This Refund Policy applies to paid subscriptions and digital services operated
by RePass Cloud Pty Ltd ("RePass Cloud", "we", "us", or "our") that link to this
policy (the "Services").

This policy is intended for business customers and authorised users, but it may
also apply to individual consumers where relevant.

This policy does not limit rights you may have under the Australian Consumer
Law or other applicable consumer protection laws.

## 2. Definitions

- "Billing period" means the period covered by a subscription charge
  (for example monthly, annual, or other term).
- "Prorated refund" means a refund calculated based on the unused portion of a
  prepaid billing period.
- "Service credits" means account credits applied to future invoices, if
  offered.

## 3. Eligibility for Refunds

### 3.1 Prorated Refunds

Unless a separate written agreement applies, you may request a prorated refund
for the unused portion of a prepaid billing period, subject to:

- Any minimum term stated on your order form or plan.
- Any non-refundable fees clearly disclosed at purchase.
- Any usage-based charges that have already accrued.

### 3.2 Full Refund Window for Renewal

If you contact us within 2 days of the start of a new billing period renewal,
you may be eligible for a full refund for that renewed period, provided there
has been no material use of the Service during that window.

### 3.3 Statutory Rights

Where the Australian Consumer Law applies, you may be entitled to a refund or
other remedy for a major failure, or other rights that cannot be excluded.

## 4. How Proration Is Calculated

Proration is calculated using the number of days remaining in the current
billing period at the time the refund request is received.

We may deduct:

- Amounts payable for usage-based charges already incurred.
- Costs associated with chargebacks or payment reversals.
- Taxes or payment processing charges where permitted by law.

## 5. Non-Refundable Items

Unless required by law or expressly agreed in writing, the following are not
refundable:

- Setup, onboarding, or professional services fees (if applicable).
- Usage-based fees already incurred.
- Fees for periods beyond the current billing period.
- Fees for add-ons already delivered or consumed.

If you paid using a method that cannot be reversed (for example certain crypto
transactions), refunds may not be available. Where feasible, we may offer
service credits instead.

## 6. How to Request a Refund

To request a refund, contact us using one of the following:

- Email: [hello@repasscloud.com](mailto:hello@repasscloud.com)
- Your customer support portal (if provided)

Include:

- The organisation name (if applicable)
- The account email
- The Service and plan
- The reason for the request

For organisation accounts, the request must be submitted by an authorised
administrator or billing contact.

## 7. Processing Time and Payment Method

- We aim to process eligible refund requests within 5 business days.
- Refunds are issued to the original payment method where possible.
- Banks and payment providers may take additional time to post refunds.

## 8. Suspension, Termination, and Misuse

We may deny refund requests where we reasonably believe there has been:

- Fraud, abuse, or misuse of the Service
- A breach of the Terms of Service
- Chargeback abuse or repeated payment reversals

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. Updates take effect when
posted with a new "Last updated" date.
