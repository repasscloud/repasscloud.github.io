## 1. About These Terms

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern access to and use of websites, products,
and services operated by RePass Cloud Pty Ltd (ACN/ABN 74 642 243 801)
("RePass Cloud", "we", "us", or "our") (collectively, the "Services").

By accessing or using the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not
agree, you must not use the Services.

If you are using the Services on behalf of an organisation, you represent that
you have authority to bind that organisation, and "you" includes that
organisation.

## 2. Services Covered

This policy applies to any RePass Cloud website, application, API, or service
that links to these Terms, including:

- Cinturon360 (enterprise SaaS platform)
- <https://repasscloud.com>
- <https://optechx.com>
- Other RePass Cloud services or service endpoints that link to these Terms

Legacy notice:

- LunaVPN is not an active RePass Cloud service. Where historical content or
  repositories remain available, they are provided "as is" without ongoing
  support or maintenance, unless expressly stated otherwise.

## 3. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. The "Last updated" date indicates
when these Terms were last revised. Changes take effect when posted, unless we
state otherwise.

If changes materially reduce your rights, we will take reasonable steps to
provide notice (for example by posting a notice in the Service or via email).

## 4. Privacy

Our handling of personal information is described in our Privacy Policy:

- /legal/privacy-policy/

## 5. Accounts and Authentication

### 5.1 Account Creation

Some Services require an account. You must provide accurate and current
information and keep your account details updated.

### 5.2 Authentication

Depending on the Service and customer configuration, authentication may be
provided via:

- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- Federated customer identity providers
- OAuth providers (where enabled)
- Password-based authentication (where enabled)

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of credentials and for
all activity under your account.

### 5.3 Customer Administrators

Where your organisation provisions access, administrators may manage your access
and settings. Some requests (for example deletion of organisation data) may need
to be made by an authorised administrator.

## 6. Acceptable Use

You must use the Services lawfully and must not:

- Access, probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of systems except as expressly
  authorised in writing.
- Interfere with or disrupt the Services, infrastructure, or other users.

  permitted by law and only to the extent allowed.

- Bypass access controls, authentication, or rate limits.
- Use the Services to violate privacy, security, export control, or other laws.
- Engage in abusive, harassing, or fraudulent conduct.
- Use the Services to transmit unlawful content or infringe intellectual
  property rights.

We may suspend or terminate access if we reasonably believe you have breached
these Terms or applicable law.

## 7. Customer Content and Responsibilities

"Customer Content" means data, content, or materials submitted to the Services
by you or on your behalf.

You are responsible for:

- Ensuring you have the rights and lawful basis to provide Customer Content.
- Maintaining appropriate notices and consents for personal information.
- Configuring the Service appropriately for your compliance requirements.

## 8. Subscription, Billing, and Taxes

### 8.1 Subscriptions

Some Services are offered on a subscription basis. Subscription features,
limits, and prices may vary by plan and may change over time.

### 8.2 Billing

You agree to pay all applicable fees, taxes, and charges associated with your
plan. Fees are generally billed in advance for each billing period unless
otherwise stated.

If payments are processed through third-party payment providers, you agree to
their terms and acknowledge we are not responsible for their acts or omissions.

### 8.3 Late or Failed Payments

If a payment is declined or overdue, we may suspend or restrict access until
payment is resolved.

## 9. Refunds

Refunds, credits, and cancellation terms are set out in our Refund Policy:

- /legal/refund-policy/

Where required by law (including the Australian Consumer Law), refunds and
remedies may apply regardless of this policy.

## 10. Intellectual Property

The Services, including software, documentation, designs, and branding, are
owned by RePass Cloud or its licensors and are protected by intellectual
property laws.

You receive a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to
access and use the Services during the subscription term, subject to these
Terms and any applicable agreement.

Except as expressly allowed, you must not copy, modify, distribute, sell, lease,
or create derivative works from the Services.

## 11. Confidentiality

Where you access non-public information (including security information,
documentation, or commercial terms), you must keep it confidential and use it
only for the permitted purpose.

## 12. Service Availability and Support

We aim to provide reliable Services, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted or
error-free operation. Maintenance, updates, and outages may occur.

Support entitlements (if any) depend on your plan or contract.

## 13. Disclaimers

To the extent permitted by law, the Services are provided "as is" and "as
available". We exclude all warranties not expressly stated in these Terms,
including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, and non-infringement.

Nothing in these Terms excludes non-excludable guarantees under the Australian
Consumer Law or other applicable laws.

## 14. Limitation of Liability

To the extent permitted by law:

- We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
  exemplary damages, or loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, or data.
- Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to the Services is limited
  to the amount paid by you for the applicable Service in the 12 months
  preceding the event giving rise to liability, unless a different cap is
  required by law or expressly agreed in writing.

## 15. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify RePass Cloud, its officers, employees, and contractors
against claims and losses arising from your breach of these Terms, your unlawful
use of the Services, or Customer Content that infringes rights or violates law,
to the extent permitted by law.

## 16. Termination

You may stop using the Services at any time. If you cancel a subscription,
access may continue until the end of the current billing period, unless
otherwise stated.

We may suspend or terminate access immediately if:

- You breach these Terms or applicable law.
- Required to do so by law.
- Your use poses a security risk to the Services or other users.
- Your payment is overdue.

Upon termination, your right to use the Services ends. Data handling after
termination is described in the Privacy Policy and any applicable agreement.

## 17. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of New South Wales, Australia.

If a dispute arises, the parties will first attempt to resolve it in good faith
by negotiation. If unresolved, either party may refer the dispute to mediation
in Sydney, Australia, before commencing court proceedings, except where urgent
injunctive relief is sought.

The courts of New South Wales have exclusive jurisdiction.

## 18. Severability

If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder remains in
effect.
