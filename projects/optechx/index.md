## Development Journey

OptechX was built with the aim of simplifying the design, development, and deployment of Windows operating system configurations within corporate networks. The journey began with a focus on seamless integration with existing infrastructure, ensuring compatibility with OEM distribution channels, MDM, SCCM, and MDT solutions right from the start.

To facilitate easy onboarding and support, OptechX offers comprehensive resources. Customers on the Business/Enterprise Plans receive dedicated onboarding support, while Basic, Standard, and Professional Plan subscribers can log tickets with the support team for assistance. Additionally, Standard and Professional Plan subscribers have the option to purchase an onboarding support package if they require collaboration with their IT support team.

With an emphasis on accessibility, OptechX is hosted on the cloud, allowing users to access the platform from any web browser, whether it's at the office, home, or even a local café. The core principle of OptechX is to streamline the process of building an SOE image, condensing it to just four simple steps. Users can choose from hundreds of supported devices, applications, and even upload customizations to bundle directly within these steps.

OptechX offers a cost-competitive and secure cloud-hosted platform designed to support businesses of all sizes, including government agencies. The platform is scalable, allowing organizations to adjust their plans as their needs evolve and their business grows. OptechX provides a comprehensive selection of Windows® 10/11 Editions and builds from the VLSC (Volume Licensing Service Center) and offers certified support for enterprise hardware from major vendors.

The platform boasts an extensive application library pre-configured for deployment, along with the option to deploy images as WIM, ISO, GHO, or VHD images. A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline enables automatic builds, ensuring the latest updates are incorporated into the images. Core security practices are ingrained in every image to prevent data loss, providing a stable and secure operating environment.

OptechX aims to simplify the management of standard views across different devices within corporate networks. By migrating the process to the cloud, the platform allows teams to plan, design, and customize their business SOE through a simple web interface. This shift frees up resources and time, enabling teams to focus on other critical tasks.

The benefits of using OptechX are numerous. It reduces the need for a dedicated full-time SOE staff member, eliminates frustration associated with PC's SOE redesign, avoids the need for training staff on emerging technologies and SOE installations, eliminates costly expenses for remote staff to mail in hardware for re-imaging, and minimizes work time lost with scheduled SOE updates.

OptechX leverages OEM support by seamlessly integrating native drivers into every image, streamlining hardware and providing out-of-box installation support for customers. With 15 years of industry knowledge and experience, OptechX prioritizes incorporating the solution within the existing IT landscape, saving organizations both time and money.

Founded on the principles of efficiency and security, OptechX has transformed the SOE design, development, and deployment process, simplifying it for businesses without sacrificing effectiveness.
